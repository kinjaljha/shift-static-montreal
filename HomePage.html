                    Aut molestiae eaque qui odit dolorum id perferendis molestias.] Over the last year, we’ve
                    interviewed 30 community workers and organizers from across Montreal who have been responding to the
                    covid crisis in ways that aim for deeper, longer term transformation in the city’s economic,
                    political and social systems. These folks work on a wide variety of social and environmental fronts
                    from food security, climate justice, defunding the police and violence against women to long term
                    elder care, homelessness, anti-gentrification, mutual aid and more.
